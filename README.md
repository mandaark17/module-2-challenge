## My Portfolio to be contined edit

- This will serve as a base point for my collection of works, so that I may make it mobile applicable in the future. I will use this website to present my capabilities to future employers.

- I built this in order to have a solid stepping stone, and spent quite a bit of time on CSS

- I learned quite a bit about the display:flex options and how to mess around further in DevTools to really see what I'm doing as I make changes to the code directly.

## Usage

Use this project as a template, not by design, but aws basic structure for the layout of HTML and calling classes in CSS.
